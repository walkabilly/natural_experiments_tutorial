Causal Revolution

Causal questions
========================================================
* Descriptive Questions
    * Do people living in non-walkable neighbourhoods walk less?
* Causal Questions
    * Would people in non-walkable neighbourhoods walk more if they move to walkable neighbourhoods?   
[Harper & Strumpf, 2012](https://www.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e31826d078d)

Methods for natural experiments
========================================================
* Difference in differences
* Interrupted time series
* Regression discontinuity
* Instrumental variables

Difference in differences
========================================================
Controls for unobserved individual differences, and for common trends assuming that the unobserved characteristics are fixed over time, and that the outcomes in each group would change in the same way in the absence of the intervention. 
* Bikeshare use: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.09.014

Interrupted time series
========================================================
* Outcome is collected at equally spaced intervals over a long period of time I Intervention/event occurs at a specific time point. 
* Intervention/event occurs at a specific time point 
* Transit strike on bikeshare use: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2019.03.018

Regression discontinuity
========================================================
* This approach exploits a step change or ‘cut-off’ in a continuous variable used to assign treatment or otherwise determine exposure to an intervention. 
* Breast cancer screening: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1893793 

Instrumental variable
========================================================
* Variable that is associated with outcomes only via its association with exposure to the intervention and is independent of other factors associated with exposure (i.e., instrument is exogenous). 
* Free transit pass and social engagement: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-210038
